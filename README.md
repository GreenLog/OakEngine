# OakEngine
A basic C++ engine I wrote last year using SDL

Has everything you need to get started on your own Game Project.

Has support for a custom scripting language, Acorn script. This language is specifically designed for an easy creation
of dialogue-based iteractions, but you can customize it however you like due to the open-source nature of the project!
